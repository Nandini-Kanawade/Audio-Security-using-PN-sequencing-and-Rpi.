# Audio Data Communication Security Using P-N Sequences and Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the security of audio data communication by leveraging **Pseudo-Noise (P-N) sequences** and the **Raspberry Pi** platform. The goal is to ensure the safe and secure transmission of sensitive audio data, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality during the transfer process.

The system works by using **MATLAB** to record and convert audio into a binary stream, which is then encrypted with a P-N sequence. This encrypted data is transmitted between two Raspberry Pi devices. Upon reception, the data is decrypted using the same P-N sequence, restoring the original audio signal.

## Purpose and Objective

The primary objective of this project is to establish a secure communication channel for audio data using P-N sequences, ensuring:
- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized interception of audio data.
- **Integrity**: Ensure that the data received is exactly what was transmitted.
- **Authentication**: Authenticate communication between devices.

The project aims to implement robust encryption techniques on the Raspberry Pi platform, providing a reliable and cost-effective solution for audio data transmission.

## Methodology

1. **Broad Spectrum Signal**: Utilizes broad-spectrum signal techniques to enhance the reliability and quality of transmitted data.
2. **P-N Sequencing**: Uses Pseudo-Noise (P-N) sequences for secure encryption and decryption of the audio data. The P-N sequences are generated using **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** technique.
3. **Secure Communication (SC) Protocols**: Integrates secure communication protocols to protect the transmitted data between the Raspberry Pi devices.

### Experimental Setup

- **MATLAB**: Used for recording and processing audio files.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Two Raspberry Pi units are used to transmit and receive the encrypted audio data.
- **Security Protocols**: Involves XOR encryption and decryption based on P-N sequences.

## Implementation

The implementation involves the following steps:
1. **Audio Recording**: Audio is recorded using MATLAB and converted into a binary stream.
2. **Encryption**: The binary data is encrypted by XORing it with a P-N sequence.
3. **Transmission**: The encrypted data is transmitted from one Raspberry Pi to another.
4. **Reception & Decryption**: The receiving Raspberry Pi uses the same P-N sequence to decrypt the data and restore the original audio signal.
5. **MATLAB Integration**: MATLAB libraries are used for seamless integration with the Raspberry Pi.

## Key Findings

- **Decryption Based on P-N Sequence Matching**: The system ensures that data can only be decrypted if the P-N sequences match between the transmitter and receiver.
- **MATLAB Libraries on Raspberry Pi**: Necessary MATLAB libraries are installed on the Raspberry Pi to handle the audio data transmission and reception efficiently.
- **Security Strength**: The project successfully demonstrates how P-N sequences can be used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted audio data.
